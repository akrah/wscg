The registration provides to us the best presence between the model and the scene. The automatic landmarks can be estimated for the scene by the manual landmarks of the model. However, the estimated landmarks can be located at the incorrect location. So, we need a method to verify each position of the estimated landmarks. For this reason, in the last step of the method, we apply a step in the SIFT[] method to verify the location of automatic landmarks. Firstly, the region around each manual and corresponding automatic landmark are created. Then the orientation and gradient magnitude of each pixel in the region is calculated and presented into a descriptor. The comparing between the descriptors is done by using L2 distance which is given by the equation (1).\\

=== equation of L2 distance

For each manual landmark on the model and corresponding estimated landmark on the scene, the small patches \textit{I}, \textit{T} are created with the size $s_1$, $s_2$ respectively ($s_1 < s_2$). Then, for each pixel in the patch \textit{T}, a sub-patch \textit{T^{'}} is extracted with the same size of the patch \texit{I}. Then their descriptor and measure distance are determined(between \textit{I} and \textit{T^{'}}). This step is finish when all the pixels on the patch \textit{T} are considered. The figure \ref{sift} is illustration of this process.

During the descriptor creation (for \textit{I} and \text{T^{'}}), the orientation and gradient magnitude are calculated for each their pixel by the equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sift}
	m(x,y) = \sqrt{(L(x+1,y) - L(x-1,y))^2 + (L(x,y+1) - L(x,y-1))^2}\\
	\theta(x,y) = tan^{-1}((L(x,y+1) - L(x,y-1))/(L(x+1,y) - L(x-1,y)))
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $m(x,y)$ is the gradient magnitude
	\item $\theta(x,y)$ is the orientation
	\item $L(x,y)$ is the value at position (x,y) in the image
\end{itemize}
