However, in some cases, the translation
 and rotation between two images are not enough
precise because the result of the segmentation contains noise. To
 improve this, we have considered some specificities of our
 images and observed that the tip of mandible is less
 noisy than its base. So, first we have sorted the contour
 points according to their y-value to build the subset
 containing the half upper part of contour points. Second, we have
 enhanced the PCA by Iterating steps on this subset until the stabilization
 (PCAI). At each iteration, the rotation value is refined and the
 procedure will stop when the new computing angle is lower than 1.5 degrees (see
 Fig. 4).
