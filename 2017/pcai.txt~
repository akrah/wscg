However, in some cases, the translation
 and rotation between two images are not enough
precise because the result of the segmentation contains noise. To improve this,We have considered some specificity of our
 images and observed that the tip of mandible is less
 noisy than its base on images. To improve registration, we have
 enhanced the PCA by Iterating until the stabilization
 (PCAI).  So, we sort the contour
 points according to their y-value to build the subset
 containing the half upper part of contour points. PCA
 is again completed for this subset to refine the rotation
 and translation values. Because the subset is extracted without 
 the noises, the result of PCA will be improved a little bit with
 the previous step. This operation is iterated until
 the new computing angle is lower than 1.5 degrees (see
 Fig. 4)
