The registration provides to us the best presence between the model and the scene. The automatic landmarks can be estimated for the scene by the manual landmarks of the model. However, the estimated landmarks can be located at the incorrect location. So, we need a method to verify each position of the estimated landmarks. For this reason, in the last step of the method, we apply a step in the SIFT[] method to verify the location of automatic landmarks. Firstly, the region around each manual and corresponding automatic landmark are created. Then the orientation and gradient magnitude of each pixel in the region is calculated and presented into a descriptor. The comparing between the descriptors is done by using L2 distance which is given by the equation (1).\\

=== equation of L2 distance

For each manual landmark on the model and corresponding estimated landmark on the scene, the small patches \textit{I}, \textit{T} are created with the size $s_1$, $s_2$ respectively ($s_1 < s_2$). Then, for each pixel in the patch \textit{T}, a sub-patch \textit{T^{'}} is extracted with the same size of the patch \texit{I}. Then their descriptor and measure distance are determined(between \textit{I} and \textit{T^{'}}). This step is finish when all the pixels on the patch \textit{T} are considered. The figure \ref{sift} is illustration of this process.

During the descriptor creation (for \textit{I} and \text{T^{'}}), the orientation and gradient magnitude are calculated for each their pixel by the equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sift}
	m(x,y) = \sqrt{(L(x+1,y) - L(x-1,y))^2 + (L(x,y+1) - L(x,y-1))^2}\\
	\theta(x,y) = tan^{-1}((L(x,y+1) - L(x,y-1))/(L(x+1,y) - L(x-1,y)))
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $m(x,y)$ is the gradient magnitude
	\item $\theta(x,y)$ is the orientation
	\item $L(x,y)$ is the value at position (x,y) in the image
\end{itemize}
Then, the descriptor is created for the patch. This is a histogram with eight direction for orientation, with the length of each bin corresponding to the magnitude of that histogram (sum of the gradient magnitude for corresponding orienation). The descriptor is formed from a vector containing the value of all the bins in the histogram. Finally, the vector feature is modified to reduce the effects of illumination change by normalization.

In the example at figure xxx, a patch with the size 16x16 is created around the landmark. For each pixel in the region, the orientation and gradient magnitude are calculated (the orientation and length of the arrows). Then, the patch is divided into 4 sub-blocks 4x4. The descriptor of each sub-block is determined by using 8-orientation histogram and the length of each arrow corresponding to the sum of the gradient magnitudes near that direction within the rgion.
